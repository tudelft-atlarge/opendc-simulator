 * The Omega simulation kernel is the reference simulation kernel implementation for the OpenDC Simulator core.

 *
 * By default, [Process]s are resolved as part of the [Topology], meaning each [Entity] in the topology should also
 * implement its simulation behaviour by deriving from the [Process] interface.
 *
 * @property kernel The kernel that facilitates the simulation.
 * @property topology The topology to run the simulation over.
 * @property clock The clock to use for simulation time.
